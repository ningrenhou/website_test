        <p>Listening to you is like listening to you. You shelve here shelve here? The situation is what it is, and what exactly it is, remains to be seen. This sentence I slammed, just slammed to see this sentence. I holler straight I holler straight. The last time I saw such a wonderful statement was the last time. I hadn't realized it before, and when I did I had. It made a little bit of sense but not a whole lot of sense. People who don't have a date should still be single. Three words to make a man listen to me for three words. When there's an avalanche, there's not a single snowflake that doesn't crumble. Every time you waste 60 seconds of your life, one minute of your life passes. When I was a kid, I was just a kid. Listening to you fart was like listening to a fart. If you're right about that, it should be. You must have been pretty skinny when you lost weight. As the saying goes: As the saying goes. As far as I know I know nothing. How thin are the wings of a cicada? </p>
